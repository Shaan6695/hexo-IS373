        <p>Virtualization and Containerization are both technologies that allow for running multiple environments on a single physical machine, but they have distinct differences, particularly in how they operate and their resource efficiency. Here’s how they compare in the context of Docker (a containerization platform):</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2786a0aa-4fc4-470a-836a-a32c86341f3f" alt="kubernetes-vs-docker-3"></p>
<h1 id="1-Virtualization"><a href="#1-Virtualization" class="headerlink" title="1. Virtualization"></a>1. Virtualization</h1><p>Definition: Virtualization uses a hypervisor to create and manage virtual machines (VMs), where each VM runs its own complete operating system (OS) and operates in isolation.<br>Architecture: Each virtual machine has a full OS, and the hypervisor sits on top of the host system to manage multiple VMs. The VMs share hardware resources, but each has its own independent OS.<br>Overhead: Virtual machines are resource-heavy because each VM includes not only the application and its dependencies but also a complete OS, which requires CPU, memory, and storage space.<br>Isolation: VMs provide strong isolation because each VM runs in a completely separate environment.<br>Use Case: Typically used when running different OSs or when strict isolation is needed.<br><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5537176c-e415-4274-a86e-e150f7713472" alt="virtual"></p>
<h1 id="2-Containerization"><a href="#2-Containerization" class="headerlink" title="2. Containerization"></a>2. Containerization</h1><p>Definition: Containerization, as implemented in Docker, allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers. Unlike VMs, containers share the host OS’s kernel, but each container operates independently with its own libraries and dependencies.<br>Architecture: Docker containers share the host OS, which means there’s no need for a hypervisor or full OS per container. This makes containers lightweight and efficient.<br>Overhead: Containers are more lightweight because they don’t require a full OS. Only the necessary binaries and libraries for the application are packaged in the container. The host’s kernel is shared across containers.<br>Isolation: Containers provide isolation for applications, but since they share the OS kernel, they offer less isolation than virtual machines.<br>Use Case: Ideal for microservices, scalable applications, and environments where multiple instances of the same OS are needed.<br><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deb8aae0-2952-4b1d-b840-ee9a210fa6d5" alt="0_i8OzbS38Oo9-MGcW"></p>
<h1 id="Docker-and-Containerization"><a href="#Docker-and-Containerization" class="headerlink" title="Docker and Containerization"></a>Docker and Containerization</h1><p>Docker is the most popular containerization platform. It enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers, ensuring that they run the same regardless of the environment. Docker containers package applications with all their dependencies, allowing them to run consistently across different environments without the overhead of virtualization. This is why Docker is favored in modern DevOps pipelines, continuous integration&#x2F;continuous delivery (CI&#x2F;CD), and microservice architectures.<br>In summary, Docker (containerization) provides a lightweight, efficient, and fast alternative to virtualization when running applications, especially in environments where agility, scalability, and performance are crucial.</p>
<p>Kubernetes and Docker serve different but complementary roles in container orchestration and management:</p>
<h1 id="Docker"><a href="#Docker" class="headerlink" title="Docker"></a>Docker</h1><p>Containerization: Docker is a platform for creating, deploying, and managing containers. It allows you to package applications and their dependencies into standardized units called containers.<br>Image Management: Docker enables you to build and manage container images, which can be stored in repositories and easily shared.<br>Development Environment: Docker simplifies the development process by ensuring that applications run the same way in development, testing, and production environments.</p>
<h1 id="Kubernetes"><a href="#Kubernetes" class="headerlink" title="Kubernetes"></a>Kubernetes</h1><p>Orchestration: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. It manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers across a cluster of machines.<br>Resource Management: Kubernetes handles load balancing, scaling (up and down based on demand), service discovery, and fault tolerance for your containerized applications.<br>Multi-Container Management: While Docker manages individual containers, Kubernetes manages groups of containers and the overall architecture, making it easier to deploy microservices and complex applications.<br>Summary<br>Docker is focused on building and running individual containers.<br>Kubernetes is focused on managing clusters of containers and ensuring they run efficiently and reliably.<br>In practice, you often use both together: Docker to create the containers and Kubernetes to orchestrate them.</p>

        <h1 id="Kernel"><a href="#Kernel" class="headerlink" title="Kernel"></a>Kernel</h1><p>When thinking about a kernel in the context of a Content Management System (CMS), it usually refers to the core component or a framework that is responsible for handing the system’s overall functionality.<br>Basically, a kernel is a piece of the entire system that essentially controls what the other components do.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/swk5-njit/IS373/blob/main/graphics/Kernel_Layout.svg" alt="Kernel"></p>
<h1 id="Core-Functionality-Of-A-Kernel"><a href="#Core-Functionality-Of-A-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="Core Functionality Of A Kernel"></a>Core Functionality Of A Kernel</h1><p>As said earlier, a kernel offers the basic features that ultimately allows the Content Management System to operate, which includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content Storage &amp; Retrieval: The process of managing how the overall content is stored through things such as databases and ultimately retrieved for display on the front end for users.</li>
<li>User Management: The process of handling processes dedicated to user authentication, authorization and roles, which ultimately allows for different users to have different access levels according to their role.</li>
<li>Routing &amp; URL Management: The kernel also defines how URLs are structured and how incoming requests are mapped to the appropriate content or funcionality that is requested.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Extensiblity-Of-A-Kernel"><a href="#Extensiblity-Of-A-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="Extensiblity Of A Kernel"></a>Extensiblity Of A Kernel</h1><p>Even though a kernel ultimately does the core functions that were described in the previous section, a CMS kernel is considered to be well-designed and robust if it also allows for modularity and extensiblity.<br>A CMS kernel is said to allow modularity and extensiblity if it offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugins (a.k.a. Extensions): Kernels typically support the addition of plugins or modules that enhance the core functionality without interfering or detracting from it. This component also allows customization.</li>
<li>Themes &amp; Templates: Kernels also provide an overall framework for using themes and templates, which is another avenue that users can use to easily customize the overall apperance of the CMS.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Performance-Optimization-Of-A-Kernel"><a href="#Performance-Optimization-Of-A-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="Performance Optimization Of A Kernel"></a>Performance Optimization Of A Kernel</h1><p>On top of performing the core functions and offering extensiblity, kernels are also designed to ensure efficient performance. Kernels offer this through two crucial components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caching Mechanisms: Kernels may implement a strategy for caching frequently-used content to improve overall load times.</li>
<li>Databse Optimization: Kernels also handle the overall efficiency of database queries and connections, which in turn ensures speedy access to content.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Security-Considerations-For-A-Kernel"><a href="#Security-Considerations-For-A-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="Security Considerations For A Kernel"></a>Security Considerations For A Kernel</h1><p>In the context of a CMS, kernel security is also paramount. This can be ensured with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input Validation &amp; Sanitization: Kernels often include methods to validate and sanitize user input in order to prevent common security vulnerabilities, which include SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
<li>Access Control: Kernels also manage permissions and overall access levels, which in turn ensures that only authorized users have the ability to modify content and&#x2F;or settings.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Workflow-Management-For-A-Kernel"><a href="#Workflow-Management-For-A-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="Workflow Management For A Kernel"></a>Workflow Management For A Kernel</h1><p>So far, it has been established that kernels have core functions, offer extensibility, ensure efficient performance and have an importance on security, but that is not all that kernels offer or do.<br>Kernels also support different workflows, which are essentially a series of steps that are necessary to complete task(s). Kernels offer this support with methods including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content Approval Processes: Kernels can define a workflow for the overall process of content creation, review and publication, which ensures that any content that is created is polished before it goes live.</li>
<li>Version Control: Kernels often include version control features which ultimately allows users to track their changes, revert to prior versions and ensure effective collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="API-Integration-For-A-Kernel"><a href="#API-Integration-For-A-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="API Integration For A Kernel"></a>API Integration For A Kernel</h1><p>If core functions, extensibility, efficient performance, security importance and workflow management were all of the things that kernels offered, think again. Kernels also offer API integrations.<br>At its core, an API or Application Programming Interface, is a set of functions and&#x2F;or procedures that ultimately allows for the creation of other applications that access the features or data of a system.<br>Moreover, API integrations allow kernels to interface with other systems and services. There are two main things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-Party Services: Kernels allow for the combination of external services which include but is not limited to social media platforms, analytics tools or e-commerce solutions.</li>
<li>Headless CMS Capabilities: A CMS can also be ran in a headless state without the user of a GUI (Graphical User Interface). This allows content to be served solely via APIs to various front-end applications.</li>
</ul>

        <h1 id="Kubernetes"><a href="#Kubernetes" class="headerlink" title="Kubernetes"></a>Kubernetes</h1><p>Kubernetes is a platform that developers can use to manage containers and containerized workspaces at a large scale. It was made open-source by Google in 2014, and it has a vast ecosystem with various tools, utilities, etc.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-Kubernetes-work"><a href="#How-does-Kubernetes-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Kubernetes work?"></a>How does Kubernetes work?</h2><p>Unlike Docker, Kubernetes is more focused on managing containers at scale, instead of focusing on one or two at a time. Kubernetes provides an application programming interface (API) that controls where and how containers run. It schedules containers to run in virtual machines based on resource availability and requirements. Containers are organized into units called “pods”, which users can then scale up and down to fit their needs. Kubernetes can also scale pods automatically, as well as managing resource allocation, balancing workloads, and monitoring the health status of resources and allowing apps to restart or replicate as needed, among other functions.</p>
<h2 id="The-benefits-of-Kubernetes"><a href="#The-benefits-of-Kubernetes" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of Kubernetes"></a>The benefits of Kubernetes</h2><ul>
<li>Kubernetes can be used to make applications portable, since they run separately from their infrastructure in containers. This means they can be moved between machines or to a cloud while remaining consistently functional.</li>
<li>Containerized applications can then be run across a cluster of servers, or multiple clusters of servers, with Kubernetes scaling them automatically to maintain the health of each container. Users can also scale their containers manually with a command.</li>
<li>Kubernetes has a vast community of users who have made tools and utilities to add more functions to Kubernetes, such as security and monitoring functions.</li>
<li>Users can give Kubernetes nodes to run containerized tasks in, and specify how much CPU and memory each one can needs. From there, the platform can allocate resources automatically to make the most effective use of them. </li>
<li>The platform automatically maintains container health by restarting containers that fail and killing any containers that do not respond to user-defined health checks.</li>
<li>DevOps practices such as CI&#x2F;CD, infrastructure as code, and constant monitoring can be employed in Kubernetes environments, which allows one to keep up with the speed at which their application grows, moving fast in a changing environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Before-Kubernetes…"><a href="#Before-Kubernetes…" class="headerlink" title="Before Kubernetes…"></a>Before Kubernetes…</h2><p>Before virtualization and containerization came to be, applications ran on physical servers. This was difficult to manage because physical servers at the time could not automatically allocate resources, which led to management issues. For example, one application would end up using most of the resources on its respective server, severely impacting the performance of other applications that ran on that server. While one solution to this problem would have been to run every application on a different physical server, this would not have worked out, since resources would go unused, and the organization in question would have to spend a lot of money to maintain that many servers. </p>
<p>Now, virtualization allows both individual users and organizations to emulate physical servers, which costs less and is easier to maintain, especially with Kubernetes. Kubernetes also prevents underutilization of resources by allocating resources to where they are most needed, increasing functionality without diminishing the performance of other applications in the same virtual machine. Containers can also run inside a virtual machine, providing another layer of security and ease of management and access.</p>
<h2 id="Kubernetes-versus-Docker"><a href="#Kubernetes-versus-Docker" class="headerlink" title="Kubernetes versus Docker"></a>Kubernetes versus Docker</h2><p>The biggest difference between these two entities is the scale at which they are used. While Docker is most often used to develop containerized applications at a personal level or to publish onto the Docker Hub, Kubernetes is used to manage clusters of containers at a much larger scale. Additionally, while Docker is used to create and run containers, Kubernetes is more oriented towards managing those containers. Finally, the main benefit of Kubernetes is that complex applications can be defined and run at scale, while Docker is beneficial for standardizing operations and shipping code quickly.</p>

        <h1 id="Virtualization"><a href="#Virtualization" class="headerlink" title="Virtualization"></a>Virtualization</h1><p>When dealing with content management systems, virtualization will most commonly refer to using a virtual machine (VM).<br>As a whole, the term refers to creating a virtual version of something, such as a document or a database, to give some examples.<br><img src="https://github.com/dfianuale/IS373/blob/main/graphics/cv1.png" alt="Virtualization"></p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-Virtual-Machine"><a href="#What-is-a-Virtual-Machine" class="headerlink" title="What is a Virtual Machine?"></a>What is a Virtual Machine?</h2><p>A VM is an emulation of a computer, which includes its kernel and operating system (the latter is called the “guest machine”), that runs on a user’s computer (referred to as the “host machine”).<br>A VM can also hold containers inside, since they run on an operating system’s kernel. One machine can also run more than one VM,<br>provided it has the capability to do so. Each VM is isolated from the others, which keeps things consistent and can also allow for<br>emulation of communication between two or more computers.</p>
<h2 id="VMs-versus-containers"><a href="#VMs-versus-containers" class="headerlink" title="VMs versus containers"></a>VMs versus containers</h2><ul>
<li>While containers run on top of an existing operating system’s kernel, each VM has its own operating system and kernel.</li>
<li>VMs are more capable than a container, but also more resource-consuming for the aforementioned reason.</li>
<li>Both a VM and a container can be scaled up or down as needed, or copied (called “cloning”), or moved to other systems.</li>
<li>As aforementioned, due to VMs having their own kernel, containers can run inside a VM, and this is common practice in the real world.</li>
<li>Both containers and VMs run in isolation to other instances of themselves, which is convenient because it prevents unwanted interaction between instances.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-do-virtual-machines-work"><a href="#How-do-virtual-machines-work" class="headerlink" title="How do virtual machines work?"></a>How do virtual machines work?</h2><p>Virtual machines are, at the most basic level, self-contained servers that use software instead of hardware for operations. The virtual macine server includes alloted RAM, CPU, storage, and a network interface, effectively emulating a real computer. The key difference is that instead of these resources being stored on dedicated hardware like with a pre-built computer, they are borrowed from the host machine server, and can be<br>reallocated to other virtual machines as necessary.</p>
<h2 id="Oracle-VirtualBox"><a href="#Oracle-VirtualBox" class="headerlink" title="Oracle VirtualBox"></a>Oracle VirtualBox</h2><p>There are many softwares available online that can be used to create and run a virtual machine. Such softwares are called “hypervisors”, and their main purpose is to manage virtual machines and keep them isolated from one another to prevent unwanted interactions. Some examples of commonly used hypervisors are Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation, and Microsoft Hyper-V, among others.<br>This documentation will teach how to install and use Oracle VM VirtualBox. </p>
<p>VirtualBox is a Type 2 hypervisor (hosted), which means the VM runs inside of a dedicated test environment on one’s operating system. Some hypervisors are Type 1 (bare-metal) instead, meaning they run the VM directly on the host machine’s hard drive.</p>
<p>Before setting up a VM, there are some prerequisites that must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your machine must support virtualization (this can be checked from BIOS or UEFI on startup)</li>
<li>You must have installed a hypervisor, which will be covered below with VirtualBox.</li>
<li>You must have a raw disc image file (.iso extension) of the guest machine operating system you want to install on your VM.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Installing-and-setting-up-VirtualBox"><a href="#Installing-and-setting-up-VirtualBox" class="headerlink" title="Installing and setting up VirtualBox"></a>Installing and setting up VirtualBox</h3><p>VirtualBox can be downloaded from &lt;virtualbox.org&gt; for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. The official documentation for the program also contains installation instructions at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/topics/installation.html#installation">https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/topics/installation.html#installation</a> for all three platforms.<br>After installation, you must open the program and configure it to use your network and host machine correctly. A number of settings such as screen resolution, proxy servers, interface theme and more are also available.</p>
<h3 id="Creating-a-Virtual-Machine"><a href="#Creating-a-Virtual-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Virtual Machine"></a>Creating a Virtual Machine</h3><p>To set up a VM, first choose the option <strong>New</strong> to be shown to the workflow to create a VM.</p>
<ul>
<li>First you must give the VM a name. This name will be shown in VirtualBox Manager and the VM’s files on disk, so be sure to choose a straightforward name that includes the OS of the virtual machine.</li>
<li>Select the install location for the VM and your OS disc image. If your guest OS has editions, you must specify the edition as well. VirtualBox will attempt to populate as many fields as it can depending on which OS you are using, but if it does not fill a field, you must fill it in manually.</li>
<li>To have the OS install automatically, you can choose an <strong>Unattended Installation</strong> and set the options for the OS ahead of time. You can also choose to skip this method and have the OS image mount on the virtual DVD for you to install it manually from within the VM.</li>
<li>Whichever of the above you choose will be followed by setting up the virtual hardware, including base RAM, processors, EFI, and a hard disk.<br><strong>WARNING:</strong> The amount of RAM you allocate to the VM <em>cannot</em> be used by the host machine OS when the VM is running. Set the amount carefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these things are set up, you can run the virtual machine from the VirtualBox interface. While it is running, you will have access to a status bar that includes tabs for storage, networking, audio, USB, and more settings. By default, the guest OS will take control of your keyboard and mouse from the host OS. To return control of the keyboard to the host OS, you can press the designated Host key. On Windows and Linux the default host key is Right Ctrl, on Mac it is Left Command.</p>

        <h1 id="The-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux-WSL"><a href="#The-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux-WSL" class="headerlink" title="The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)"></a>The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</h1><p>Today, some computers offer dual boot functionality, which allows a user to install more than one operating system at the same time, on the same machine. But doing this usually requires the installation of extra software or an overhead, and only one of the operating systems can be actively used at a time. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is an alternative option that allows Windows users to install a full installation of Linux, complete with utilities, BASH commands, and application compatibility, onto an existing installation of Windows.</p>
<h2 id="Why-you-should-use-WSL2"><a href="#Why-you-should-use-WSL2" class="headerlink" title="Why you should use WSL2"></a>Why you should use WSL2</h2><p>With WSL2, users can develop programs for Linux and store files in an isolated environment, while still having the ability to communicate with the host machine as needed. Users can utilize the BASH shell and other command-line tools to run scripts and applications. WSL2 is not limited to Ubuntu either - users can select which Linux distribution to install on the host machine. </p>
<h2 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h2><p>WSL2 runs a Linux kernel inside of a lightweight virtual machine, and the distribution of Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc., also called a “distro”) then runs as an isolated container inside of that virtual machine. There are two versions of the Windows Subsystem for Linux: WSL1 and WSL2. Compared to WSL1, WSL2 is more capable, offering increased system performance and full system call compatibility, a system call being an entry point into the operating system from a process. When installing the subsystem, in addition to choosing which distro to install, users can specify whether that installation uses WSL1 or WSL2.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-install-the-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux"><a href="#How-to-install-the-Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux" class="headerlink" title="How to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux"></a>How to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux</h1><p>The only prerequisite to install WSL is the operating system on the host machine. It must be running either Windows 11, or Windows 10 version 2004 or higher. To install WSL2 from the command line, enter this command into the Command Prompt (CMD) or Powershell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wsl –install</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By default, this command will install WSL2 and Ubuntu on the host machine. To choose a Linux distro manually, append this flag onto the above command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-d (distro name here)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* Note: Running CMD or Powershell as an administrator is not required to install WSL2.</p>
<p>The command with the flag added can also be used to install another Linux distro after one has already be installed. After installing a distribution, the host machine must be restarted for the install to take full effect. The first time a distro starts up, a command window will open which will tell you to wait while the distro unpacks files to store on the host machine’s system. Afterwards, it will prompt you to either create or log into a Unix account, Unix being the OS that Linux is built off of.</p>
<p>To switch the version of a Linux installation from WSL2 to WSL1 or vice versa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wsl –set-version (distro name here) (1&#x2F;2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a distro is installed and unpacked, it can be run from the Start menu by typing its name and opening the program, which will open it in a console window. You can also open it by typing its name into a Command Prompt window, which will open the distro in a separate console. To open it in the current window, type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wsl (distro name here)</p>
</blockquote>
